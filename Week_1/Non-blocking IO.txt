Non blocking IO:

	Non blocking IO means any process which is requesting IO operations should not be blocked unless the required IO resources are busy.
	IO operations are performed independent of the other system operations.
	IO operations mainly consists of fetech operations,reading a file,accessing a memory location etc,.
	CPU operations are based on the processors present in the system.

Nodejs supports Non blocking IO.
