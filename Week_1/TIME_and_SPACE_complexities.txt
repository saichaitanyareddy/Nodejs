The complexity of an algorithm is a function describing the efficiency of the algorithm in terms of the amount of data the algorithm must process.
There are mainly two types  of complexity measures. They are:
1)Time Complexity: 
Time complexity is a function describing the amount of time an algorithm takes in terms of the amount of input to the algorithm.
2)Space Complexity:
Space complexity is a function describing the amount of memory (space) an algorithm takes in terms of the amount of input to the algorithm.

Both Time and Space complexities are usaually measured using Asymptotic notations.
1)Big O
2)Big omega
3)theta
4)little omega
5)little O
1,2 are used to measure worst case complexity of an algorithm.
3 is used to measure average case complexity of an algorithm.
4,5 are used to measure Best case complexity of an algorithm.
