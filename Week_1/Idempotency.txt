An idempotent HTTP method is an HTTP method that can be called many times without different outcomes.
It would not matter if the method is called only once, or ten times over.The result should be the same. 
It essentially means that the result of a successfully performed request is independent of the number of times it is executed. 
For example, in arithmetic, adding zero to a number is idempotent operation.
POST method is not Idempotent i.e each time you execute a post request a new resource is created changing the state of the resource.
GET, PUT, DELETE, HEAD, OPTIONS and TRACE are Idempotent i.e these methods doesn't change the state of the resource.
