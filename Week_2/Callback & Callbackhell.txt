Callback:
	A callback function is a fucntion which will get executed after a function has been executed it's task.
	It is similar to executing functions in a sequence but this allows performing other actions/events asynchronously while these functions are executing.
	Example for callback is in file callback.js
Callback hell:
	It is a scenario when there is a long nesting of callback functions.It is difficult to trace the code and code looks like hell of callbacks.
	Callbacks hell can be resolved by
		i)  writing the code in modules and separating each module as a file and importing them when required.
		ii) using promises.
		iii)Instead of using anonymous functions assign names to each function.
	
	Example:append_async file consists of nested callbacks which is difficult to read/understand.
