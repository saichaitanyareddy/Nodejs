Promise:
	callback results in callback hell when many callback funtions are used within a fucntion.
	While promise is similar to callbacks but provides readability and understanding of code to the user.
	A Promise is a value returned by an asynchronous function to indicate the completion of the processing carried out by the asynchronous function.
Promise is in one of the following three states:
	pending - The initial state of a promise.
	fulfilled - The state of a promise representing a successful operation.
	rejected - The state of a promise representing a failed operation.

Advantages of using promise:
	* Readability of code.
	* avoiding callback hell.
